    "2. Attach the pen to the end-effector and write an impedance controller that can draw a circle in the x-y plane at a frequency of 0.5Hz, i.e. the end-effector should follow the trajectory $$x_{ref}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3 + 0.05\\cos(\\pi t) \\\\ -0.2 + 0.05 \\sin(\\pi t) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
