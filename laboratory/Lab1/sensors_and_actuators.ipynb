    "The robot is constituted of 4 rigid bodies together 3 joints. There is one motor per joint and we can send a desired torque to each motor and read the position (angle) and velocity of each joint using the position sensor attached on each motor (the internal software computes the velocities using finite differences).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/finger_edu_1.jpg\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the robot are avaiable [here](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/blob/master/mechanics/finger_edu_v1/README.md#fingeredu-v1)\n",

    "# PyBullet - a robot simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) is a \"rigid body dynamics\" simulator, it means that it can simulate any articulated, rigid, robot. For example our NYU finger but also more complex robots, such as a humanoid, a quadruped or a hand. It can also simulate other objects and several robots at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, every simulator functions as follows:\n",
    "* First a description of the objects and robots to simulate are given, including their dynamic properties (masses, center of mass), their \"boundaries\" (to detect collisions between objects) and graphic files to visualize the robot. The visualization is often different than what is simulated (i.e. we often simplify the geometry of the robot, e.g. using cylinders, for the simulation but display all the details in the visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each instant of time, the simulator keeps track of all the collisions between all the objects, to know where to compute contact forces. Typically the collisions are simplified to make the simulation fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simulator then computes all the forces exerted on all the objects and robots (e.g. gravity, contact between objects, etc) and uses Netwon's law of motion to compute the next position and velocity of all the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/simulation_loop.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can then decide to apply forces/torques on certain joints, like a motor would do and read all the available information from the simulator to emulate real sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a user, we then need to write a \"controller\" that decides what to do at each simulation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with the real robot\n",
    "Each robot has different interfaces to be able to read its sensors and send control commands, which can be different from the robot simulator code. For this laboratory, we have wrapped all the functionality needed from PyBullet into the class NYUFingerSimulator located in the file [nyu_finger_simulator.py](./nyu_finger_simulator.py) which also contains the same functions to control the real robot. Therefore, the controllers you write will work both in the simulator and the real robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We detail below the typical control loop we will use throughout the class."

    "# Typical control loops with sensors and actuators\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss in this section how we can make the robot move by sending motor commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every robot comes with a set of actuators that need to be controlled. Typically, a set of \"low-level\" controllers are available such that one can send a desired motor torque or a desired joint position and the robot controller will transform this into a current to modulate the rotation of an electric motor or the opening/closing of a pneumatic or hydraulic valve. This in turn will create a movement of the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our class, we will assume that we can send a desired joint torque and that it will be achieved on the robot. PyBullet enables the same level of \"abstraction\" which is sufficient for most robot applications.\n",
